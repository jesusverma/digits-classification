# system requirments

# set up conda env 
conda create -n digits python=3.9

# how to run
python exp.py

# places of randomness
- Creating the split
    - freezing the data
    - data order (learning is iterative)

- model
    - weight initialization (but it will not impact much in this case)

- 

# Meaning of failure
- poor perfomance metrics
- coding runtime/compile error



- the model gave bad predictions

# feature 
- vary model hyper parameters
